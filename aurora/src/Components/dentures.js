Dentures are used to replace missing teeth that can be taken out and put back into your mouth. There are two types of dentures available: partial dentures and complete dentures. The type that is needed can be determined by Dr. Sheth. Typically complete dentures are used to replace all teeth and partial dentures are used when you still have some of your natural teeth in place.<p></p>
<p>Dentures are employed so that patients who suffer from tooth loss because of periodontal disease (gum disease), tooth decay, or traumatic injury don’t have to suffer the negative effects of not having teeth. Besides the obvious reason of eating, replacement teeth are needed so that remaining teeth do not shift and so that a sagging facial appearance does not give the impression of making one appear older than they are.</p>
<p>Dentures have a brief adjustment period and never feel exactly the same as one’s natural teeth. However they are designed to be comfortable and functional and have a similar appearance to natural teeth, improving the smile and facial appearance.</p>
<p><strong>How Do Dentures Work?</strong><br/>
Depending on the type of denture you need, complete or partial, will determine how the dentures fit and function. Dentures are custom-made in a dental laboratory from impressions of your mouth that Dr. Sheth will take in a preliminary evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Partial Denture-</strong> A removable partial denture or bridge usually is made of replacement teeth attached to a gum-colored plastic base, which rests on a metal framework that attaches to your natural teeth. Partial dentures are used when one or more natural teeth remain in the upper or lower jaw. A fixed bridge will replace one or more teeth by placing crowns on the teeth on either side of the space and attaching artificial teeth to them. The partial denture not only fills in the spaces created by missing teeth, it prevents other teeth from changing position. They are removable and have internal attachments rather than clasps that attach to adjacent crowns for a look that is more natural-looking and comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Denture-</strong> Complete dentures contain a flesh-colored acrylic base that fits over your gums. The base of the upper denture covers the palate (roof of your mouth), and the lower denture is horseshoe shaped to accommodate the tongue. Complete dentures can either be “custom” or “immediate.”</p>
<p>Custom dentures are made after the teeth have been removed and the gum tissue has begun to heal. This type of denture is ready for use about 3 to 6 months after tooth removal. Immediate dentures are made in advance and can be positioned as soon as the teeth are removed, so that the wearer does not have to be without teeth for the healing period as in conventional dentures. The disadvantage to this is that they must be relined several months after being inserted. Bones and gums shrink over time, especially during the healing period following tooth removal. For this reason immediate dentures should only be considered a temporary solution until conventional dentures are made.</p>
<p><strong>Denture Adjustment Period</strong><br/>
A new set of teeth will take some adjusting and adapting for feel, eating, and speaking. Initially the dentures may feel a little odd or loose for a few weeks until the muscles of your cheek and tongue learn to keep them in place and you get comfortable inserting and removing them. It is common for minor irritation or soreness to occur and for saliva flow to increase when you first start wearing dentures, but these problems will diminish as your mouth adjusts to the new denture.</p>
<p>Learning to eat with new dentures also takes a little practice and wearers may experience a few weeks of an uncomfortable adjustment period. Dr. Sheth will most likely recommend that you start eating soft foods cut into small pieces as you grow accustomed to eating with dentures. After the initial adjustment period you can go back to eating whatever it is you like as part of your normal diet. There are however, some foods that you may want to avoid such as hot or hard foods and sharp-edged bones or shells. You may also want to avoid foods that are extremely sticky such as gum or chewy candies.</p>
<p>Some patients have experienced difficulty pronouncing certain words. This is normal and takes a little practice to learn to speak properly with dentures. If the speaking problem persists then you should call our office at 630-820-8550 to consult with Dr. Neha Sheth. Additionally if you experience irregular periods of discomfort, you should contact Dr. Neha Sheth for assistance with your dentures. Your dentures may require repositioning as they may occasionally slip when you laugh, cough, or smile.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives to Dentures</strong><br/>
Dental Implants can be an ideal solution for people with dentures, providing replacement teeth that are as close to your natural teeth as possible, regardless of whether youâ€™re missing one tooth or an entire set of teeth. The Dental Implants are anchored into the jawbone like natural teeth; making your replacement teeth so strong that slippage becomes a thing of the past. With your new Dental Implants, youâ€™ll be able to eat whatever you like more comfortably and speak with confidence.</p>
<p>It is common for Dental Implant patients to experience a greater quality of life. They feel more comfortable and secure with their Dental Implants than they did with removable dentures. There are all sorts of problems that can plague denture wearers. Dentures can slip and click, causing embarrassment in social settings. They can restrict your diet and make you look older than you are. Art of Modern Dentistry uses Valplast, a lightweight, flexible, and virtually unbreakable denture that almost disappears inside the mouth.</p>
<p>Dental Implants allow for a happier, more active lifestyle. They allow you eat the foods you want to eat and allow you to speak clearly and with more confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Dentures Cost</strong><br/>
Most dental insurance providers will cover some or all of the costs incorporated with dentures. Contact our office at 630-820-8550 to find out more about the specifics of what they will cover and eligibility requirements. As with most dental procedures, dentures cost will vary depending on several different factors, including:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li>The possibility of additional dental procedures such as removing teeth or oral surgery to refine bone </li>
<li>The complexity of the removable denture that you require </li>
<li>Materials selected by you and Dr. Sheth. Denture materials vary between more expensive highly cross-linked polymer denture teeth that are more esthetic to conventional plastic teeth that are less expensive</li>
</ul>
<p>We run specials from time to time.  Please call our office at 630-820-8550 to find out more about Dentures and cost.
